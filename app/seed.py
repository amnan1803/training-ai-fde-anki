"""Seed sample data on a fresh database.

The seed is designed to make both planted bugs observable out of the box:

* Deck 1, "AI Glossary", has one card due yesterday and one due tomorrow, so
  ``GET /decks/1/due`` reveals whether the due check points the right direction.
* Deck 2, "Empty Deck (new)", has no cards and no reviews, so
  ``GET /decks/2/stats`` exercises the retention calculation on an empty deck.
