"""The AI feature: draft flashcards from a topic using Claude.

Uses the official Anthropic Python SDK with *tool use* for structured output — we
define a single tool whose input is a list of {front, back} cards and force the
model to call it, so we read cards straight from the tool input with no brittle
string parsing.

If ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set, ``generate_cards`` raises ``AINotConfigured`` and
the route turns that into a clean 503 — the rest of the app runs fine without a key.
